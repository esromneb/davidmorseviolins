<i>A conversation with violinist, tone connoisseur, and client Fritz Schleicher<br>
4th of October, 2011</i>

<p>Fritz- The physical object of the violin is can be analyzed artistically, do you agree that violin making is reproducing what your master tells you, buy some good wood, and hope it comes out well?</p>
<p>David- Although sprinkled with a healthy portion of "lets see what shows up", I am intrigued with the possibility of juggling with the dozens and dozens of parameters where I can shape and participate in it's energy. Although it is important how the materials are fashioned, I am most focused on being aware of the energy all the way through the making process. Starting with choosing the wood, I go to Europe and cut my own spruce logs and go to woodcutters that cut logs of maple. Why? I like to see when and how the wood is harvested. What is the attitude of the workers? Are they just interested in making the most profit, or are they passionate about providing the best cared for offering possible, taking efforts to cut in the right season, dry it properly, make the highest quality cuts that make a difference in the end, when the violinist puts a bow to the strings. In terms of the spirit that I hope to impart to the violin, I have asked myself certain questions. Rather than having a set or established way of violin making, at the bench, right now, what does the energy of the moment tell me about what I am about to craft. How could it be better, what question haven't I asked, is this the best way to do this part of violin making? Every time I sit down. There is an energetic meditation. Listening for the answer is an attunement to a spiritual energy. Surrender my heart and mind to what shows up in the moment.</p>
<p>Fritz- Can you give me an example of this process?</p>
<p>David- A hidden part inside the violin most violinists don't see are the linings. They are the little strip that runs inside, along where the top and back meet the ribs of the violin. I read that Strad used Italian Willow and Guarneri used Spruce. After building a violin with willow, I took it apart and replaced the linings with spruce. Out of that experience, my personal choice has been Spruce, the question still comes up in the moment, when I make linings, "energetically, what shows up as the best wood and technique to use for THIS violin?" I have explored alternative woods, alternative grain orientations, different densities, and different ways to glue them in. This approach comes from the knowledge of this spirit... My violin making is best informed, if I don't carry the "rules" I used last time, but to listen for the answers to the questions that come up NOW.</p>
<p>Fritz- Are your violins recognizable, considering you make all these experiments?</p>
<p>David- I strive to make the form of my violins a consistent recognizable trademark, yet always open to the possibility of an evolving form. Freedom to explore the edges of conventionality. To really understand tonal results, only one major experiment can be done at a time. Otherwise the evaluation can be too complex and the energy can't be understood.</p>
<p>Fritz- Guarneri didn't have laser scans and modern scientific electronic equipment, how could he produce such interesting and great sounding instruments so full of life?</p>
<p>David- It is obvious that Strads craftsmanship was superior to all makers in the town, but Del Jesu also stood out in comparison to other Cremona makers. He put the sign of Christianity on his label. Others didn't make such a statement. I think his spiritual nature is a part of his success.</p>
<p>Fritz- How could that affect his violin making?</p>
<p>David- Being raised as an artist, educated to be an artist, but also having a spiritual nature, somewhere in those many many hours at the bench I have tried to visualize and imagine the mind of Guarneri, the talented 18th century craftsman- shaman. I ask- how could I step into those shoes, learn what energy propelled him, and apprentice at the feet of someone so talented yet so distant in time? There are clues, big clues. Del Jesu's training as a youth included learning from the lineage of his grandfather, uncle, and father. He lived 3 doors down from the older Stradavari, so he was surrounded by the precepts of classical Cremonese violinmaking. Eventually Del Jesu took the reins and followed the family tradition for a while. But there was a force not bound by material convention or the constructs of the Renaissance or the paradigm of traditional Cremonese violin making that began to inform his approach. Was it his spiritual pursuit? Looking at the deviation of arching, sculptural approach, and aesthetic sound concepts, did he start to loose his grip on this world and gain a vision of a higher order informed by the spirit of the moment- tapping into the blissful creative process? I think so.
With these imagined eyes I look at wood, arches, and varnish not as a scientist, but as a small town Cremonese worker scientifically limited , but having a cornucopia of intuition, guesses, and approximations. In an effort to adopt this technique, I have subjectively tested nearly every solid object in my wood pile by rapping with my knuckles trying to inform my senses about what things "sound" like.</p>
<p>Fritz- Can you give me an example of one of these tests?</p>
<p>David- I have looked under magnification the cells and grain of spruce, maple, and ebony, questing to unlock the connection between the size of the wood fiber, and the character of the sound. For instance, depending on where maple grows in Bosnia-Serbia the grain is course, fine, distinct, or homogenous. To a maker, we have to compensate for the differences in this wood nature. But how? Only thru building violins could this knowledge expand. But when the wood is used, one can't go back and make the top or back in a different way. Buying large quantities of a particular log (consistency), and commit time and energy to make a number of violins, adjusting the way it's built and the "soup" of woods that are married together to make a whole violin became a reliable alchemy of approximations. Soft with hard, spirited with relaxed, clear with warm. Although not "scientific" these metaphors have been the foundation of many artists including myself. How to make a sound that appeals to the subconscious as well as the conscious mind. Like the bold stroke of Rhodan's gesture created in bronze that could not be imparted by attempts using realism Maybe we can't explain what we feel when we see it, but our subconscious does.</p>
<p>Fritz- But isn't preference for a Del Jesu violin come from his consistent approach?</p>
<p>David- I think part of his success was that he DIDN'T make instruments to be all alike, or from a preconceived idea. He started them and let the energy of the moment or "spirit" guide him- to let the instrument be brought to life, playfully responding to what had to be adjusted to the playfulness in the moment. The working approach of the master fulfilling his intellectual and creative destiny like Strad is different than Del Jesu- letting spirit guide his quixotic imagination.</p>
<p>Fritz- There are amazing modern violin makers who make flawlessly crafted instruments, how does you violins compare?</p>
<p>David- I have seen perfectly crafted violins where there are no flaws, yet the violin has no heart or life. Earlier in my career, I strove towards a perfectly crafted violin, but I asked -what does that mean? Perfect looking, what does perfect look like? A perfectly machined part accurate to one thousands? To me, violins like that look cold and unfeeling. I think that perfect looking means- when you look and play the violin, you sense the hand, heart, and creativity of the maker everywhere. It comes from the energy that is breathed into the violin the moment it was crafted.</p>

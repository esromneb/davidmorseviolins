  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">David Morse's conversations with John
  Simmons 9/8/99</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: You come from a visual arts
  background. When did you know you were going to be a violinmaker?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: That was in 87. I'd been
  making violins for about 4 years.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Can you describe your education?</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: I went to Omaha School of
  Art, and got a degree in commercial art. Shortly thereafter I
  was drafted and went through engineering, intelligence and officer
  training in the military. While I was in Vietnam, I did military
  intelligence analysis for General Abrahams and Westmorland at
  the headquarters in Saigon. When I got back, I went to Southern
  California and went to Mount San Antonio College and took art
  and sculpture classes among general requirements. I moved up
  to Santa Cruz to complete my degree in sculpture and painting
  at UCSC. I also did some advance work in acoustics and sculpture
  at Sonoma State</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Acoustics AND sculpture?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: By that time, I realized
  that my educational goals were pointed towards musical instrument
  building for a living.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: When did you start to work
  on musical instruments?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: Out of high school. In 1966
  or 67 I bought a guitar from Mexico. I had taken it apart and
  rebuilt it, so that was really the first indication that I was
  interested in and liked working on musical instruments. When
  I was in Los Angeles, I made one flattop and one very strange
  guitar, more of a sculpture than a playing instrument. Around
  the time I arrived in Santa Cruz, I met Darrel Anger. He and
  I and some other luthiers made a number of carved top bluegrass
  mandolins. Not playing mandolin myself, I moved on to an instrument
  that I could play. It was then that I started building jazz guitars.
  I made jazz guitars that I sold to people like Earl Klugh and
  John Abercrombie. By that time, I had made a number of different
  types of instruments: banjos, mandolins, flattop guitars, and
  archtop guitars. I realize when I look back, I always had a great
  fascination with and reverence for the violin and never really
  knew whether or not I could make one.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: It&#146;s intimidating.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: It wasn't so much the actual
  construction of the violin. I looked at the difficulty of making
  the violin and it seemed an acceptable challenge. What seemed
  intimidating were the violinists. I had an original impression
  that the the kind of demands and critiques that violinists had
  about their violins were too great, I simply could not come up
  to that level of scrutiny. But at some point, after having been
  so successful with mandolins and guitars, I tried. It was then
  that I realised that the violinist was the key. They had much
  of the knowledge necessary to achieve an excellent violin tone.
  I always create my own interpretation of any instrument that
  I build. My first violin had many of the elements that I use
  today.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: The violin you sell today
  represents your latest attempt to catch a particular sound?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: Yes. It is like throwing
  the discus, or dancing a pirouette. It&#146;s only as good as
  the training that brought you to the present, plus your awareness
  and your focus on the event as its happening. It&#146;s fascinating
  how violin builders approach the craft. There are violinmakers
  who were once machinists, physicists, woodworkers, mathematicians,
  sculptors, engineers, artists, craftsmen and others. They all
  bring a certain library of skills, whereas the whole violinmaker
  is more of an alchemist.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: What do you mean?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: The scientist deals with
  what he can know, the alchemist deals with what he can know and
  also chaos. Because chaos is infinite just like knowledge is
  infinite, it&#146;s always infinite.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: That's right -- there's
  the same amount of chaos left over afterward.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">(Laughter)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: The metaphor of the scientist
  is like this: you have all chaos out there, you make a hypothesis,
  you go into the machinations of the experiment, and conclusions,
  and so at your conclusion, you go back to chaos. Scientists have
  this little bit, something they&#146;ve controlled. The problem
  is, what they control is very, extremely narrow. Every time they
  try to make some kind of analysis of the violin, they have to
  make it provable and it has to be very, very narrow in scope
  to make it provable.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">The alchemist is like this:
  he peers into the chaos, in the past and up to his present, and
  then he makes an assumption about what he sees at that moment,
  and it&#146;s based in Now. Its not based on what you can build
  on in yesterday's information so you can use it for tomorrow.
  Then he turns around and he acts on this observation and then
  he returns to chaos. And he's comfortable and he lives in chaos.
  He relies on the analytic processes in the brain that escapes
  categorization. Some call it a mystery, I call it a tool. He
  doesn't live in this small area that's confined to what he can
  know. So at any moment in time, you can grasp a universe, a harmonic
  symphony, a snapshot of what's occurring at that moment. But
  it's a much better, more open and informative view if you can
  suspend all that you know.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">I started off following some
  of these scientists where they put the glitter on the violin
  plate and then they put a loudspeaker underneath it and get the
  thing to bounce and you can see the vibrations. It&#146;s called
  free plate tuning. But free plate tuning has very little to do
  with the violin after its put together. It&#146;s very different!
  Completely different. I knew that 300 years ago they had this
  intuitive nature. I started thinking about my own thought processes
  and Pop!, the mind has this incredible ability to take mustard
  and locomotives and put it together and lead to dining cars.
  Take totally separate elements and somehow make a fusion. Nothing
  else can do that, like that part of the human mind. So I decided
  that I would just observe, continue to add information and not
  necessarily document and write it down but leave it in the bio-computer.
  And just work it, and work it, and work it, and have an experiential
  feel of the violin and to listen to the people who knew more
  than I - which are the players. I let them tell me the many faceted
  explanations of sound that musicians hear and use. It&#146;s
  too coarse, it&#146;s not open enough, or it&#146;s not loud
  enough, or it doesn't play staccato. Then l try to visualize
  what it is that the violin's doing to improve that particular
  characteristic. This is the place where alchemy comes in. Alchemy
  is a wonderful metaphor for this.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: You don't know to move the
  violin arch because you've seen empirical data from some sound
  test that indicated that moving the arch would do that. You know
  that from your personal &quot;field&quot; of experience. It&#146;s
  in your cell memory in a sense, because you've done it. It is
  neural- linguistic.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: I don't do it simply as
  my own path, but I look at the great master violins that people
  are playing today and emulate and try their physicality.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: So occasionally you'll hear
  a master violin that relates to the tone you hear in your head
  and you think that there's something in this that I want.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: I came to searching for
  my own sound in a very overt objective way when Isaac Stern was
  showing me his Guarneri violin. I was looking at it, and he was
  looking at my violin and he played it. He said, &quot;This is
  not an Italian violin sound, but it's a very good sound&quot;.
  And I realized, wow, I'm certainly not going to come up with
  the solutions they came up with, or if I did, no one will know
  for 150 years. He kind of pointed the path down my own road.
  I had been slavishly trying to get what other people call the
  Italian violin sound. I realized I don't have to adhere to this
  search by copying other violins. Now, it really is about 75%
  copying ideas and about 25% or maybe less of my own ideas. The
  visual aesthetics of the violin are very separate from the aural
  aesthetics. Because you're fashioning this tone through a very
  direct, mechanical means. Which means, what you're really addressing
  is, how the structure is manipulated to make that sound.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Which is physics, its mechanics.
  Those scientific disciplines can be used to describe your work,
  but not predict it. That's the whole difference.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: To me, the whole thing defies
  description. I can only say that it&#146;s chaos, and it&#146;s
  alchemy, and they all come out differently, and whatever I put
  into them is an occurrence of what happened at that moment with
  those particular pieces of wood.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: So it&#146;s an interaction
  between you, the mood you're in at this period of your life,
  the wood that you choose, the input you get from your customer.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: And the character of the
  good violins that I've seen at that time. It&#146;s like Paul
  Klee. He was really criticized heavily by the art community in
  New York, because once he became famous, he bought back some
  of his old paintings and redid them. It made many people upset,
  because you can&quot;t see the evolution of his ideas, if they
  are erased. It made me realize that what I'm creating every moment
  is something that will never occur again. For me or anybody else.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: If a musician contacts you
  and asks you to build a violin for them that has specific characteristics,
  that will be another factor among all these others that will
  affect the resulting violin. How customized are your violins?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: They're not very customizable.
  I feel that the path that I'm on is very focused and I can produce
  a very special need for a soloist and symphony musician. My violins
  are easy to play, and yet they are very difficult to play. They're
  easy to play because the bow immediately lights up the strings,
  immediately you get illumination and sensitivity, be that breathy
  or a very powerful quality. But, because the sound is so transparent
  and open and clear, it reveals all the nuances of the player
  and the more sophisticated the player is, the better the synergy
  is.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: So your violins would unmask
  a dilettante.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: Yes.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Lets talk about who is the
  appropriate user of your violin. Sort of a profile of the appropriate
  user.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: I'm a toolmaker. I make
  tools for people. The tools that I make are crafted and they're
  art pieces and yet they are tools for someone else to craft and
  create art on. As a tool, its best in the hands of someone who
  is an accomplished violinist who wants to get the strength, power,
  and subtlety out of a violin. My violins all have a very powerful
  clear projecting tone, very articulate. Every nuance in the hand
  and arm come out in the sound. Ray Kobler played one of my violins
  while the concertmaster of the San Fransisco Symphony. He once
  joked that he could always pick out my violins, because they
  all come out bold and powerful.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: It's a challenging violin.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: It challenges the player,
  but it&#146;s an interesting thing. For the talented player,
  they put the bow to the violin and I see this awareness that
  they have all this subtlety. And, as soon as they recognize that,
  the violin gives it to them, they give it to the violin, and
  the violin gives it to them, and there's this circular thing
  that happens, and all of a sudden, they're playing who they&#146;re
  being. What's inside comes out, because there's little technical
  impediment or physical barrier between them and what they want
  to create.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Your violins lack the dullness
  and sluggishness a poor violinist might hide behind, if they
  have poor technique.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: I don't want to characterize
  it in that way because there are other people who are creating
  violins that have a broad tone and they're warm and they're luscious
  and when you play them, no matter what you play on them they
  just make a wonderful sound up close, but they don't project.
  Perfect for some players.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Of that one kind (of sound).</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: My violins are for someone
  who has a very distinct and clear image of what they want to
  create on a violin. A lot of musicians don't realize how much
  energy they use in compensating for the physical limitations
  of the violin. Its all analog, so there's a spectrum of how these
  violins respond. In a lot of violins, the hair simply doesn't
  want to pick up the string. To be able to get a real clear tone
  is very difficult on these violins. As you pass the bow over
  the string, there are milliseconds of scraping sounds before
  the string actually picks up and starts to make the full vibrational
  spectrum. It&#146;s primarily coloration. How long it takes a
  violin string to pick up and vibrate, is one way of telling how
  good or bad the violin is.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: So your violins are highly
  responsive, and therefore dangerous, to some people. I'm gonna
  rob this bank with my violin! (laughter) So getting back to who
  you see using your violins. Is it someone who is doing quartet
  work, or bluegrass work, or playing in a violin school with 20
  other violinists?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: Well it could be any of
  those, a bluegrass player, or someone who plays quartets, someone
  who's at violin school, or who just graduated from college with
  a major in music performance on the violin. The people who typically
  buy my violins now are symphony orchestra players or soloists.
  They are the ones who are the happiest with what my violins can
  do.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Do you find that they understand
  without all this talking, you put it in their hands and they
  go, Ahh!</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: Yes.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Can we talk about some of
  the variables that go into the physical production of the violin?
  The varnish, the wood, the pegs?</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: One of my parallel searches
  is measuring the density&#146;s relationship to stiffness in
  materials. Then I try to make an analysis after the violin is
  built. What did choosing this wood do the sound? A scientist
  is going to say it&#146;s impossible! You can't do that. But
  an alchemist can do it! There are two succinct ways to say what
  a violin is: The violin is a series of approximations, and it&#146;s
  an exercise in matching impedances. Everything in the violin
  has to be balanced. That's kind of an abstract, technical way
  of saying what a violin is. If the whole thing is perfectly balanced
  except for a part that is 1/5 thicker than it should be, you've
  lost whatever else is going on. The violin is only as good as
  the weakest link. One of the starting places is the wood. There
  are obviously great violinmakers who have gone about making violins
  without electro-spectral analysis. I think that one of the most
  traditional ways of analyzing wood to see whether it should go
  into a violin, is to tap on the piece in the raw form and say,
  Ahh! That sounds good. Or, Ahh, that doesn't sound good. That
  is what I see a lot of violinmakers do. I discovered that free
  plate tuning has a very limited application and reflection of
  what the plate does once it&#146;s in the violin. It's a little
  like taking a fender off a car and trying to test it's aerodynamics
  in a wind tunnel to see how the shape could be improved. I also
  realized that it&#146;s true of the wood. Choosing a piece of
  wood that sounds good when it's a log, or a board before you
  start to carve it, really has very little to do with the final
  violin sound of the piece when it&#146;s in the violin.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: That sound environment is
  so different from the final one, that it could even trick you
  into a false decision.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: I feel like it tricked me
  for years. At a point in my examination, I took really varied
  kinds of wood and made four violins with really different woods.
  All four backs were very different, and all four tops were very
  different. And I made a violin with all of them, and then I switched
  all the parts. To see where the sound went.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: So there's a little bit
  of the trial and error method in your madness.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: Absolutely. Although I've
  gained lots from that, that has also misled me. Because it was
  only four violins, and it was only at that moment in time, and
  it was only what I knew at that moment, to get the result. But,
  nonetheless, it pointed me in the direction of the materials
  that were actually producing better tone.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Where are you now in your
  examination of woods? What woods are you using now?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: The sooner the tree is cut
  and taken down into a small piece and dried, the better the results.
  So when I go to Italy, I only want to examine the trees that
  were cut within the last week. I'll look at trees that were cut
  within a week, and then I cut and split it just as soon as I
  can, so it can dry out just as quickly as possible. My thought
  is, if you take a carrot out of the ground and eat it right then,
  its really crisp. You leave it in the salad bin in your refrigerator
  for three weeks; you know what you get.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Can you describe your procedure
  in going out and hunting for wood?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: For the most important part,
  which is the top, I really search a very narrow area in Italy.
  I look for the annular rings and the structure of the annular
  rings. I look for whether the tree has twists, a lot of bark,
  a lot of knots, etc.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Do you personally pick a
  tree and say, this is the one I want?</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: Yes. Then, I'll cut and
  split it up and let it dry, and ship it back to the USA. Probably
  75% of the wood I cut, once its dry, I won't use. There's only
  a very select number within the tree that fits my criteria and
  certain trees are drier or wetter than you think they are and
  have different characteristics when they're wet than when they're
  dry. Which is why I think this idea of hearing the log come down
  the river or hitting the tree with an axe to choose wood is romance,
  not alchemy.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: How did you come to prefer
  this one type of tree in Italy?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: I knew that there was a
  reason why the Italian violins had a unique tone. They didn't
  have some of the downfalls that the violins built with woods
  from other areas had. I was at a convention and I saw this violin
  and the piece of wood for the top was just magnificent. It was
  so beautiful. It was a student made violin, and I asked her where
  she had purchased this marvelous wood. She said, right near Cremona
  Italy. Two months later I was in Italy.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Do you sell any of this
  spruce?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: Absolutely! If anyone would
  like some they can contact me through my e-mail.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: How do you choose the wood
  for the back?</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: The back is equally important,
  but has a different role to play. The differences in grain on
  the maple are more varied than in the spruce. The spruce is more
  uniform and consistent, whereas maple can be very tightly curled,
  or broadly curled, a lot of different grain configurations that
  affect the tone.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: What about the varnishes?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: There are a few different
  aspects. People have said that the Stradivari's violin sound
  great because of the varnish. But many of those old Strads have
  very, very little of the original varnish left, most of its is
  worn off in the first five years after it&#146;s creation. So
  it&#146;s not all in the varnish. But the varnish is the fingerprint
  and the artistry of the maker. So the quality of the application,
  and the vision that the artist has, makes a difference. If you
  hand the same varnish to ten people, you'd come up with ten different
  looking violins. Because of how they apply the varnish. So it&#146;s
  not only the elements that are there, but also how they're utilized.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Do you use anything that's
  different from other violin makers when you make your varnish?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: Not really. There are just
  really solid varnishing fundamentals. Having a degree in sculpture
  and a degree in commercial art has trained my eye. I see the
  shape and color of the violin with an artists eye. It&#146;s
  not like everyone else's.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: So you came to violin making
  already a sculptor and a painter. So how do you bring your trained
  visual sensibility to bear on your violins, which, after all,
  are not only aural violins?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: That's the amazing part
  of it. Violinmaking has a craft quality to it, it has an artistic
  quality to it, it has a musical, aural, and engineering quality.
  After making and designing a number of violins -- mandolins,
  guitars, and banjos -- during and after my time at the university
  studying sculpture, I realized that there are certain elements
  that you better not mess around with. If you mess with those
  elements sculpturally, if you mess around with the basic tenets
  of arching in a violin you no longer have a violin. It may look
  really wild and be really nice sculpturally, but its not going
  to sound like a violin. So I spent a number of years examining
  and separating the function of the violin from the form. I was
  looking for how the aesthetic form sometimes influences the acoustic
  structure. Or, how they captured the structural form that was
  necessary to make the sound. Some great artistic geniuses embellished
  or augmented that structural form with something that was pleasing
  to the eye. Which is a great feat in the original and initial
  violin. The Renaissance had a artistic style that reflected the
  culture and life of the times. You know, at that period of time,
  for craftsmen, philosophers, and artists, a a clear and precise
  symetrical form was their ideal. Because I spent some time examining
  the function and form separately, I said &quot;I'm working on
  the structure and analyzing it to improve the sound. Otherwise
  I'm free, I have this form; I have this beautiful shape that
  I can change, as long as I don't tread on the structural aspects.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">My sculpture professor at the
  University of Santa Cruz, Jack Zajak, said that one of the great
  aspects of art is its timeliness. Great artists absorb society,
  the interrelationships between people and reflect that in their
  work; they have a vision of where we are now and where we can
  go to create a new future. As soon as you capture the imagination,
  it has a deep message that's both personal and universal.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: You can actually change
  history with artistic vision.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: What I see in this shape
  that I have chosen is a 21st century form that no longer has
  rigid straight lines and symmetry as it's theme. Rather, as much
  as I can, I've infused organic shapes into the violin. So nowhere
  is there a corner or an edge that is ridgid. There are more dolphin-like
  forms and forms echoing blooming flowers, in a subtle way. I
  just see these as reflections of nature. I want to promote a
  future that is more organic and interactive with the natural
  world around us.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: This is a fabulously Taoist
  way to do things.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: It looks out into the 21'st.
  Century.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: The scroll is a specific
  example of that.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: I was taking a nap in the
  redwoods in the Santa Cruz mountains, and when I woke up, I was
  laying on my side, and right in front of me, about 6 inches away
  from me was a fiddle fern partly unfolded. I didn't think anything
  of it. But it was very strong image. 3 or 4 days later I was
  peering out into the Pacific Ocean, sitting on a cliff somewhere,
  and this fiddle fern came back in front of me and it turned into
  a violin scroll. Right in front of me. But it wasn't rigid and
  stiff; it was as you would see it in nature, slightly tilted,
  with soft edges. I did some sculptural models and settled on
  an interpretation. Now my scroll has a physical form that is
  organic and not linear. It asks the viewer to change the way
  he looks at it, liberating the eye from the constraints of symmetry.
  Anytime you see a flower or something like that, you want to
  look around it. You want to see its subtlety, the beauty in its
  imperfection.To me, my scroll gives the violin a warmth and a
  feeling of being alive.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Do you carve them all the
  same?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: I only use one side pattern
  and the concept stays the same. Still each one is unique with
  it's own character.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Where else do you depart
  from the classical violin shape?</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: The corners of the violin
  intrigued me from the very beginning. When I would look at the
  violin from the side, I just felt that aesthetically this looks
  so boxy, because of the repetitive lines. The back and front
  edge of the violin and the two corner points from the side, make
  it look very much like a box. So, by curving the points inward
  slightly I break up that rigidity. I also take the corners on
  the top and the back and carve them to look like they move or
  spill over.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Like a gutter spout.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: Or like a curled leaf. It
  adds flow to the shape. Another thing that Jack Zajack said about
  sculptural forms is that if you can get the person to look all
  around the object, you've succeeded artistically. I feel like
  it does, it creates a little tension. The eye says, oh, this
  flows somewhere and the eye searches to find out where it goes.
  Curiosity moves the eye around to understand the whole shape.
  Then the form can come alive. After I had built violins for a
  number of years, I started seeing the static quality of the perfling.
  The black stripes are always uniform in size, and the white is
  in the middle. A frame around a painting is generally broader
  at the outside and more detailed towards the painting, which
  kind of draws your eye into the painting. So I simply made the
  blacks thicker on the outside and thinner on the inside to draw
  the viewer into the violin. As the perlfing turns into the corner,
  it looks more 3 dimensional. I stop the perfling across the button
  on the back of the violin because it makes for a stronger acoustical
  connection with the neck. The button isn't cut through, so the
  wood isn&#146;t weakened. There's an acoustic reason for it.
  Also having those two points almost wanting to touch one another
  creates a little visual tension. It&#146;s resolved visually
  at my initials. The f-holes are functionally similar to the Stradivari
  f-hole, but they offer a strong aesthetic shape on their own.
  Also, I take the scroll box and make it softer and wider, to
  make it physically easier to access. So you can get in there
  and change strings without much difficulty.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">I've designed an endpin and
  pegs. I carefully control and choose the density and stiffness
  of the wood for those elements, and I've designed them to match
  the rest of the violin. Its an echo of other pegs you see where
  the ring is an inlaid piece of brass, and there's a round piece
  of wood that's stuck on the end there called a pip. The pip inevitably
  falls out or starts buzzing. This new peg and end pin design
  incorporate these shapes into the wood sculpturally in one piece.
  It adds a nice detail to the pegs. The tailpiece is designed
  very carefully density-wise and stiffness-wise to maximize the
  tone of the violin.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">As far as the actual shape
  of the violin, I basically fall within the basic limits and parameters
  of Stradiveri and Guarneri, because on that end of the spectrum,
  I don't want to depart from the physical form aspects that create
  great violins. My variations are within those limitations. Arches,
  same way. Very classic.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: You were quick to that insight
  because of your painting background. Can people who attend a
  concert see and appreciate these things?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: The subtle changes I've
  made on the violin can't be seen past about six feet. I've handed
  my violin to people who have no prior knowledge of the violin
  idiom and they detect no difference. Unlike changes to the violin
  such as the duck scroll and the flying saucer f-holes that otherviolinmakers
  have used to be creative, my forms are classicistic. Artistically,
  I really like what they've done, but I just have my own vision.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">J: Surely the player themselves
  notice the sculptural elements you've added to the violin, and
  furthermore, like them. It affects their playing positively?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Eurasia">D: I see myself as a matchmaker. I am happiest 
    when I place a violin or viola with somebody who falls in love with it.</FONT>

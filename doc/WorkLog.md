# Removal of interview

* `shell.tpl` has the images stacked up, I removed one
* menuImg, menuA had to be reduced
* all high number php pages need to be renumbered
* I made custom home images which are the same dimensions as the menu items
  * Now that intervew is out, I need special code to rewrite the number
  * I'm too lazy to rename the image files


original:
```
    "presentation.gif",   // 0
    "instruments.gif",    // 1
    "gallery.gif",        // 2
    "interview.gif",      // 3  X
    "stringsarticle.jpg", // 4  X
    "endorsements.gif"    // 5  X

# Are you looking for a new, high quality violin?
See David Morse Violins here: http://www.davidmorseviolins.com . High quality hand crafted.

# Presentation
The presentation was originally designed in flash. I may have lost the original source flash flie.

Because flash player is removed from all browsers I am using `core.ruffle.7f6d216454b6a4a07936.js` to emulate flash, see https://ruffle.rs/ .

# Left menu font
I may have lost the left menu source photoshop file, as a result I don't know which font the text is.  I suppose I could do some node js trick to render a new one and make them consistent as well as expandible without opeing photoshop?
